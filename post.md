# Lab 3: Crafting a 7-Segment Ramp Circuit


## Overview and Motivation
In this week's lab, we will use an analog input to display a number on a 7-segment display. A 7-segment display contains 7 leds that are arranged to form a number. We will design and build a more complex combinational circuit to display a number corresponding to an analog input. Given the complexity of this circuit, we will use K-maps in order to minimize our circuit expressions so it will be simpler for us to build the circuits that will help us perform the 7-segment using analog input.

**Main goal**: Build a combinational circuit to perform the 7-segment. The digital signal will be a decimal value between 0 and 5 inclusive.

This is the circuit overview

To achieve this goal, we will use the voltage divider.
